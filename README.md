#Monte Carlo Simulation Class

Assembles the common features of the Monte Carlo simulation into a set of classes.
It is iterative in nature as the subtleties of implementation are
worked out. A number of the existing exercises (See Git repositories
Digital_Dice, Duelling_Idiots, etc.) are used to help verify the developing
classes (see Digital_Dice files ending in MCS for examples).

This has been changed recently to accommodate a template approach.
